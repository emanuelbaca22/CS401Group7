# Chat-Simulation
Chat Communication Project
This was the main working project that was assigned in my Software Engineering course, we were tasked to create a program where Users can login
and chat through the application. 
This application will be able to handle multiple users by having a listener thread that awaits new connections, then creates a new child thread that handles the process.
By doing this, the users that login will be able to communicate with each other in real time by utlizing multi-threading capabilities
